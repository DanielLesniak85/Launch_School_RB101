#this method will return the sum of two integers#

Start
# puts - will prompt the user to enter the first integers
# num1 gets.to_i - will capture the user response and turn into an integer
# puts - prompt the user to enter the second integer
# num 2 gets.to_i - will capture the second input and mutate to integer

# assign a new variable sum that is the first and second integers 
# print the value of sum ot the screen
END

#this method will take an array of strings and return a string that is all those strings concatenated#

Start
#assumes the array is already stored into a variable
# could use the #map or #each methods to iterate through the array
# with each element of the array, could use #to_s.join()
# print out the concatenated string 
#end

#this method will take an array of integers and return a new array with every other element#

Start
#assign the array to a variable
#assign another variable with an empty array
#iterate through the array with some method like each or map
#reference the iteration to the arrays index number 
# shovel the associated index numbers value into new array
#print new array
# END
